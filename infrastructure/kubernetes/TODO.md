- See if I can move environments/dev/core/secrets.yml back into base/core/secrets.yml, and simply overwrite it in prod with the secrets from GitHub Actions
- Can I remove the CI/CD step to delete the db migration job now that it has a TTL?
- Need to figure out how I can rerun pipelines and grab the latest documentation (that is currently happening in the Docker image)
  - Should this instead be part of some GitHub actions workflow that deploys with latest documentation on a cron schedule? 
- Use checksum/config annotation with Helm to auto-deploy pods on config map and secret updates
- As part of this, we should have a deterministic naming scheme for secrets that we pull from GitHub, eg "env-var-secrets-prod.yml" so that we can use Helm to determine which environment's config we're using for the checksum
- Figure out why Docker caching is not working.  Ideally, it's working even for JS and PHP package installation.
- Should I use Helm values to swap in local image names when testing k8s locally?
- Add liveness probes to API.  I already have a /health endpoint to ping, but even though it's returning a 500, the probe is passing.  I should make sure that hitting /health on the nginx server is, in fact, returning the value from HealthController.
- Review all "TODO" items
