- Need to figure out how I can rerun pipelines and grab the latest documentation (that is currently happening in the Docker image)
  - Should this instead be part of some GitHub actions workflow that deploys with latest documentation on a cron schedule? 
- Use checksum/config annotation with Helm to auto-deploy pods on config map and secret updates
- Figure out why Docker caching is not working.  Ideally, it's working even for JS and PHP package installation.
- Add liveness probes to API.  I already have a /health endpoint to ping, but even though it's returning a 500, the probe is passing.  I should make sure that hitting /health on the nginx server is, in fact, returning the value from HealthController.
- Review all "TODO" items
